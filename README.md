# Word List App

Automate your vocab word list creation. Anytime you read a word in your target language that you don't know, drop it add it in the Add Word page. When you've put a lot of words in, you'll see all the words you dropped in, in order of how many times you saw them. This will help you see which words you should study sooner and which words you should study later. Works for any language written in utf-8 characters including (but not limited to) English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and Thai.
